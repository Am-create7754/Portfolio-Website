# My React Project

This is a simple React application built with TypeScript. Below are the instructions for setting up and running the project.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-react-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd my-react-project
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the application in development mode, run:
```bash
npm start
```
This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

### Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will generate a `build` folder with the optimized production files.

## Usage
